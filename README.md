Task tracker for learn ruby on rails!

First commit after hw3 is done
Homeworks 4,5 and 6 are done.
Pagination was added
sorting for names of tasks aka assignments
the user is also able to choose if the tasks will be sorted by name, created_at or deadline
validation for names of projects and tasks in the app as well as in the database app
registrations and sessions manipulation using devise was added
for each user the email will be shown on the top right side of the navigation bar
No user is allowed to see other user's projects or tasks thus not being able to edit or delete them

A comment section was added, now the user is able to comment on each assignment (create, edit and destroy)
